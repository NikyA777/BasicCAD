## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description

The second assignment is to create the caster mount.  The caster's dimensions are 120 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 4 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges. It also has a 25 mm hole in it's center.

## Fork

### Description

The third assignment is to create the caster fork. This part has more steps then the last two, it's less simple.The forks's first part starts with an 8mm thick, 60 mm centered-at-origin circle. On top of that circle a rectangle is drawn with the dimensions 40 mm x 5 mm, 15 mm from origin. It is extruded 75 mm, and then moderated with three fillets. The first pair of fillets are 15 mm at the edges, then 1 mm filets on the front and back of the edges, and a 4 mm fillet around the base.
